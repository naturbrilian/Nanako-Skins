1. Intro
   - First of all, thank you for using this skin, including as a reference and for other purposes. Actually, this skin is only for version 5.40 and above, and we plan to convert this skin for users of version 4.00, but of course with very limited features due to the very old player version. Please use this skin wisely for your projects and do not sell it. I would greatly appreciate it if you repost it on other sites and include the names naturbrilian or gingalibadeidara.
